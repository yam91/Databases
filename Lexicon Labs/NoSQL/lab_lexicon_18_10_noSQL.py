Collections:

-Store product details like name, price, category, stock quantity, and a list of customer reviews.
-Store categories with attributes like category name, description, and a list of products in that category.
-Store customer information like name, address, and their order history.
-Store details of customer orders including customer ID, products purchased, total amount, and the status of the order (pending, shipped, etc.).
 
Insert data:

-Add customer data with initial information.
-Insert some orders where customers have purchased multiple products.
 
Good luck!
